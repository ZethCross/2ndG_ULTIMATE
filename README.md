This is a texture replacement set for use with the [FUComplete](https://github.com/FUComplete/Patch) patch for MHP2G, swapping intro & UI textures from [MHFU-HD](https://github.com/grimmtusk/MHFU-HD) over [2ndG_ULTIMATE](https://github.com/theALXm/2ndG_ULTIMATE).

I did not make these textures. I am not in the business of making HD textures. Credits go to __theALXm__ for 2ndG_ULTIMATE and __grimmtusk__ for MHFU-HD.

MHFU-HD is no longer worked on, but 2ndG_ULTIMATE might get more updates in the future for the remaining maps. I will update this repo should there be any new textures.

If you don't like certain textures from MHFU-HD, you can replace them with the original texture files from 2ndG_ULTIMATE.

Neither set includes HD armor textures. If any exist for P2G let me know and I can add them. FU is more complicated because the hashes don't match.

## Installation

Copy the __ULJM05500__ folder to one of these locations. You may need to make the _TEXTURES_ folder if it doesn't already exist.

* __PPSSPP__: _\<MEM STICK DIR\>/PSP/TEXTURES_, you can use [this page](https://www.ppsspp.org/faq.html) to help find _MEM STICK DIR_

* __RetroArch__: _\<SAVE DIR\>/PSP/TEXTURES_, where _SAVE DIR_ by default is _\<RetroArch install location\>\saves\PPSSPP_. This is not the _PSP/SAVEDATA_ folder. See the [docs](https://docs.libretro.com/library/ppsspp/#directories) for directory layout.
